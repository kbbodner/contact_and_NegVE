# contact_and_NegVE

This repository is for the paper, "Higher contact among vaccinated can be a mechanism for negative vaccine effectiveness", currently available here: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.25.22274266v2 with a plain-language summary of the paper found here: https://mishra-lab.ca/2022/05/12/higher-contact-among-vaccinated-can-be-a-mechanism-for-negative-vaccine-effectiveness/

The R scripts, "contact_and_NegVE_SEIR.R" and "contact_and_NegVE_SIR.R" contain code to 1) run the main simulations with an SEIR and SIR model, respectively, and to 2) generate all figures in the manusript (including those in the supplementary material). It calls in "VES_and_ContactIncrease.csv" and "VES_and_VEI.csv", which contain the scenario data used to produce the contour plots (Figure 1c and d). 

The R scripts,"contour_data_generation_SEIR.R" and "contour_data_generation_SIR.R" contain code to run sensitivity analyses using SEIR and SIR models, respectively. "VES_and_ContactIncrease.csv" and "VES_and_VEI.csv" were generated by "contour_data_generation.R".
